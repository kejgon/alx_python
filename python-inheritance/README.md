# Python Inheritance - README

## Overview

This provides a practical guide to understanding and implementing Python Inheritance, a crucial concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). Inheritance allows a new class (derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base or parent class), promoting code reusability and creating a clear hierarchy among classes.

## Introduction to Python Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Python's OOP paradigm, allowing for the creation of new classes based on existing ones. The derived class inherits attributes and methods from the base class, facilitating code organization and reducing redundancy.

## Defining Classes

To create a class in Python, use the `class` keyword:

```python
class BaseClass:
    # Class definition goes here...


## Inheriting from a Base Class

To create a derived class that inherits from a base class, use the following syntax:

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # Additional attributes and methods for the derived class...

## Overriding Methods
Derived classes can override methods from the base class to customize their behavior. This is achieved by defining a method with the same name in the derived class.

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    def overridden_method(self):
        # Custom implementation for the derived class...

##  Super() Function
The super() function is used to call a method from the parent class within the overridden method of the derived class.

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    def overridden_method(self):
        super().overridden_method()
        # Additional implementation for the derived class...
