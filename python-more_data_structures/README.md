# Python Data Structures

This project provides a collection of commonly used data structures implemented in Python. The goal is to offer a reference for understanding and using various data structures efficiently.

## Available Data Structures

1. **Stacks**: Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure.
2. **Queues**: First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure.
3. **Linked Lists**: A collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
4. **Trees**: Hierarchical data structure with a root element and subtrees.
5. **Hash Tables**: Data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
