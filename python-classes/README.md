# Python Classes Reference

This project provides a comprehensive reference for understanding and using classes in Python. Classes are a fundamental part of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, enabling the creation of reusable and organized code structures.

## Introduction to Classes

Classes in Python provide a way to bundle data and functionality together. They act as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. Using classes promotes code organization, encapsulation, and reusability.

## Defining a Class

To define a class in Python, use the `class` keyword followed by the class name:

```python
class MyClass:
    # Class definition goes here...
Class Attributes
Attributes in a class are variables that store data. They are defined within the class but outside any methods.


class MyClass:
    attribute = "example"
    
Class Methods
Methods are functions defined within a class. They operate on the class and its instances. The first parameter of a method is always self, representing the instance calling the method.


class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        print("This is a method.")


Instance Objects
Instance objects are created from a class. They encapsulate data and provide a way to interact with the class methods.

my_instance = MyClass()
